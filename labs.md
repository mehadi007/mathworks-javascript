# Labs

## Lab 1.1

Copy **templates/index.html** into the **main** folder.  
In the **main** folder, add a file **index.js**. Have that file log something to the console ("Hello, world" or similar).
In the **main/index.html** add a `script` tag to refer to **index.js**. Then load **main/index.html** into your browser and look at the results

### Experiments

- What happens if you add a script block before or after the `script[src]` tag in **main/index.html**?
- What order do the scripts run in?

## Lab 1.2

Using the code in **demos/bootstrap-components.html**, add a button to **main/index.html**.  
Add code to **main/index.js** so that when the user clicks on the button, a message appears on the console.

## Lab 1.3

Add another row and column to **main/index.html**. Inside this new row/column, put a `div` with the id _output_.  
Change the code in **main/index.js** so that the message appears in the `div#output` element.

### Experiments

What happens if you click on the button more than once? Does the message appear more than once?
